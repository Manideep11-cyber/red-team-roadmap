## About
This is *my* roadmap to become a Red Teamer. Iâ€™ll focus on building solid foundations in networking, operating systems (Windows & Linux), and programming (Python, Bash, PowerShell), then learn offensive
techniquesâ€”reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, post-exploitation, and persistenceâ€”using free/open tools. I will practice in legal, safe labs (local VMs, TryHackMe, Hack The Box),
document every exercise as a reproducible write-up, and track measurable goals (daily labs, weekly write-ups, monthly projects) until Iâ€™m job-ready.
